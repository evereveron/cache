remember to immediately create Blocks after cache (array) creation.
  INITIALIZE EACH BLOCK -> VALID TO 0
  
free memory

TO DO: figure out how to read the file....
  fgets (string)
  fgetc??? (char)

Should I have made an element struct and put that inside the Block struct?????????

LRU strategy is linked list??
